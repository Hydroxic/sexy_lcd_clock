# Sexy LCD clock add-on for Firefox

catweazle's [LCD clock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lcd-clock/) add-on is the best one. No-brainer. But, it's incompatible with FF 57 `WebExtensions`-only support (and will never be :rage:). This is the replacement of that add-on implemented in `WebExtension` format.
